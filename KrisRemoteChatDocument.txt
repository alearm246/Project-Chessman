Great job

Ok, now time to get pyxel

Woot

:D

ok

almost there


ARE YOU READY??

:D

haha

ok, so now I'm going to set you up like I did Luis

Watch closely

We want to keep our original code, have a separate place for code we're working on, and keep our assets organized

Now you have a file you can play around with, and if anything breaks you can grab another copy of 02 jump_game

Make sense?

Perfect :)

Did you take note of where I put your project folder? It's in your documents

See now?

Great

Just cleaning up after myself

Do you have a code editor?

You have IDLE installed on your computer, but you can find better editors

If you double click on the file, it launches your game

To edit it, you want to right click it, then go down to "Edit With IDLE"

It's an extremely basic editor, but should work for now

We can get you something much cooler soon

When you make a change and want to see it in the game, go to the menu bar and click "Run->Run Module"

When you're done, just exit the game, make another change, then run the module again!

Going to save this file in your project folder so you can look back at it if you need to see my random one sided conversation :P
